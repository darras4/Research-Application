# Stable Matching with Indifference

This code implements a stbale matching algorithm with indifference. 

## Function
The code starts by generating two lists (one for men and one for women) where each man and each women has n preferences that are sorted in order. The function stablemarriage(men,women) takes the two lists and matches them according to each man and womans preferences.

## Issues
The code is a little buggy due to it being rushed and done inbetween other assignments. Sometimes the function matches a person twice, other times it does not match a person at all. The code is also missing some error catching and the GUI has not been implemented.
